This Python project demonstrates key concepts from Portfolio Theory for a three-asset portfolio. It computes and visualizes the **Minimum Variance Line (MVL)**, the **Minimum Variance Portfolio (MVP)**, and a **portfolio achieving a user-specified target return**.

## Features
- Compute the **Minimum Variance Portfolio (MVP)** for three assets.
- Compute a **portfolio achieving a target expected return with minimum variance**.
- Visualize:
  - Minimum Variance Line (MVL)
  - Individual assets
  - MVP
  - Target return portfolio
- Interactive input prompts for expected returns, volatilities, correlations, and target return.
